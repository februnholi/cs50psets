1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures, like user CPU time used, integral shared memory size, page reclaims and other statistics.

3.  Because that would use more memory (to copy values) and then time spent between operations could be increased (more operations required).
4.  The for loop goes through each character in the text file until EOF is returned from fgetc (when there is nothing to get, it returns EOF or -1). While it reads a character it then checks if it is alphabetic. If it is, it appends that alphabetic in the current word or begins a new one. It uses index to control if it is a current word (index > 0) or a new word (index == 0). It also checks if a word has numbers in it, to ignore those words. if it has started a word and it finds \0, it declares the end of that word and reset index and increase word counter. It then verifies the spelling, trying to find in the dictionary file, and  if it is not found, it prints that word and increase misspelling counter. it repeats until fgetc returns EOF. 
5.  fscanf stores commas, pontuaction in the arrays. It would rely in new checks to check nonalphabetical characteres and remove them before comparing to words in a dictionary.
6.  So they cannot be changed inside the functions load and check.
