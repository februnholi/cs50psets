1.  The <stdint.h> is a header that declares sets of integer types having specified widths, for example: uint24_t denotes an unsingned integer type with 24-bit width.
2.  It specifies how data / integers should be used in that program.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
4.  It must be "BM" or 0x4d42 in hexadecimal
5.  bfsize is the size, in bytes, of the bmp file. bisize is the number of bytes required by the structure (BitmapInfoHeader)
6.  Then the image is top-down, and it starts in the upper left corner
7.  biBitCount determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap
8.  If you are opening a file using r then that file MUST exist, otherwise fopen will return NULL. The program is checking if the file exists, otherwise will display an error message and stop running it.
9.  Because it is reading just 1 block each time (1 RGB at the time)
10. zero = (4 - ((3 * 24) % 4)) % 4
11. It skips paddings and looks for the next pixel instead
12. To instead set "inptr" to a location defined in constant SEEK_CUR
